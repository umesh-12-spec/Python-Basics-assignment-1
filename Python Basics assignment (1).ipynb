What is python, and why is it popular?\n","    - Python is a high level, interpreted programming language. It is known for it's simplicity and readability. It is designed by Guido Van Rossum in late 1980's and officially released in 1991. It supportts multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n","    \n","    It's popularity stems from :-    \n","    => It is easy to use as it contains simple syntaxes and it is beginner-friendly.    \n","    => It is used in wide range of applications, in Industries such as :-  web\n","       development, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, game development, automation and many more.     \n","    =>  It has a huge collection of libraries and frameworks, which makes development faster and more efficient.   \n","    => It runs on various operating systems. like Windows, MacOs and Linux. making it highly portable.     "],"metadata":{"id":"BjJMEheeldhf"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2. What is an interpreter in python?     \n","    - An interpreter is a program that executes python code line by line, translating it into machine language. It allows the code to run directly            without compilation. This makes python easy to use for scripting and debugging. Interpreter also provides immediate feedback on errors during          execution."],"metadata":{"id":"sdGYoFV8_3IG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["3. What are pre-defined keywords in python?\n","   -  Pre-defined keywords in python are reserved words that have special meanings and purposes in the language."],"metadata":{"id":"DFgxWTZwBOjw"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","   -  No, keywords cannot be used as variable names."],"metadata":{"id":"SWGgSUhmBy-K"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["5.  What is mutability in python?\n","   - If the value of an object can be changed after they are created, then this ability of changing value is called as mutability."],"metadata":{"id":"VRYK-HNxCJKM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","   - Lists are mutable because they are designed for collecting various data which needs frequent changes like adding or removing elements. Where            as, Tuples are immutable to ensure data integrity and allows to use as dictionary keys or in sets."],"metadata":{"id":"gutAB-NbDYmC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["7. What is the difference beyween \"==\" and \"is\" operators in python?\n","   - The operator \"==\" checks weather if two objects have same values or not.

What are logical operators in python?     \n","   - In python, logical operators are used to combine conditional statements like if, while, etc.  \n","      There are 3 types of logical operators.

What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","    - Impliciit type casting is done automatically by python when it converts one data type to another like int to string.

What is the purpose of conditional statements in python?\n","    -  Conditional statements allows a program to make decisions based on weather a condition is true or false.

How does the elif statement work?\n","     - Elif statement is used after if statement. It is used to give multiple number of conditions/statements in a program. first if statement will            be checked. If it is satisfied it will go to the next statement which is elif. Now, if this elif statement is satisfied it will go to next              statement to check, or else it will block the code there itself and neglets the next statements and executes the program and so on. In this             way elif statement works."],"metadata":{"id":"qNMYhr8gJgD7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["13. what is the difference between for and while loops?\n","    - A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence when the number of iterations is known where as while loop is used when the number of iterations          is not known and depends on a condition being true."],"metadata":{"id":"paxTpJ8SKadJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["14.
